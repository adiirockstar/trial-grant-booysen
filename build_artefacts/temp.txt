I love animals - dogs, cats, turtles you name it. Part of me wishes to become a park ranger but I know my true love is solving problems. But if I were to decide on the job that would bring me peace, it would be wild life conservation. I grew up camping in wild life reserves such as Sondela. I think camping was my first love now that I think back. Save the rhinos, save our animals, save our planet.
