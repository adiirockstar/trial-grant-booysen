# Codex Agent Project Development Log

This file documents the workflow in the format:

**Prompt → AI Response → Final Code Snippet**

---

## 1. How do I build this project?

**Prompt:**
How do I build this:

> *Ubundi Trial Project: Build a Personal Codex Agent*
> Objective: Build a context-aware agent that can answer questions about you as a candidate—based on documents and data you’ve created...
> (Full brief provided above.)

---

**AI Response:**

Got it — you want a battle plan for **actually building this Codex Agent project**. Here’s how I’d structure it so you hit the 6–8h budget, tick all the evaluation boxes, and still have something polished to show:

---

### 🛠 Step 1: Gather Your Training Data

* Put your **CV** in `data/cv.md` (or PDF).
* Add **2–3 extras** (blogs, README, code comments, personal notes).
* Keep them authentic: they don’t have to be fancy, but they should represent your voice.

👉 Example:

* `cv.md` — professional highlights.
* `blog_debugging.md` — short post on how you learn/debug.
* `readme_feature_store.md` — a technical project doc.

---

### 🛠 Step 2: Decide on Architecture

Two lightweight paths:

1. **With RAG (recommended)**

   * Embed docs (SentenceTransformers / FAISS).
   * Retrieve top chunks as context.
   * Pass them into an LLM with your **system persona prompt**.

2. **Without RAG (fallback)**

   * Store curated snippets in JSON.
   * On each question, pull from rules (skills → CV, values → notes).
   * In README explain how you’d add RAG later.

---

### 🛠 Step 3: Persona + Modes

* **System Prompt**: “You are Grant’s Codex Agent. Speak in first person, concise, pragmatic, with dry humor.”
* **Modes** (radio button in UI):

  * Interview → concise, professional.
  * Story → longer, reflective.
  * Fast Facts → bullet points.
  * Humble Brag → confidence boosted.
  * Reflect → self-assessment.

---

### 🛠 Step 4: UI

* Use **Streamlit** (quickest to deploy).
* One-page app:

  * Sidebar → choose mode, upload docs, rebuild index.
  * Main → ask a question, see answer + citations.

---

### 🛠 Step 5: Logging & “Show Your Thinking”

* Keep `artifacts/` folder:

  * `design_notes.md` → explain choices.
  * `prompts_log.jsonl` → log prompt → AI → code.
  * `sub_agents.md` → e.g. “Helper agent for chunking text”.
* The app can also auto-log interactions to `/logs`.

---

### 🛠 Step 6: README

Include:

* Setup (`pip install -r requirements.txt`, `streamlit run app.py`).
* Sample questions & answers.
* Design choices (RAG, persona, fallback mode).
* Improvements with more time.

---

### 🛠 Step 7: Deploy

* **Easiest**: Streamlit Cloud (free, just push repo).
* Alternatives: Replit, Vercel.
* Add link to deployed app in README.

---

### 🛠 Step 8: Submission

* GitHub repo with:

  * `/data` (your CV + supporting docs).
  * `/artifacts` (AI collaboration history).
  * `/rag` (RAG code).
  * `app.py` (Streamlit).
  * `README.md` (full guide).
* Short **video walkthrough** (<5min).

---

✅ That’s it — you’ll have a functioning Codex Agent that:

* Speaks in your voice.
* Uses your real docs.
* Has modes/personality.
* Shows AI-collaboration artifacts.
* And is simple to run.

---

**AI Follow-up:**
If you want, I can hand you a **ready-to-run starter project** (already zipped with Streamlit app + RAG setup + sample docs) so you just drop in your own CV/blogs and tweak persona.

👉 Do you want me to share that starter so you can just plug your data in and go?

---

**Final Code Snippet:**

```python
import os
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader, TextLoader

def load_documents(data_path="data"):
    docs = []
    for f in os.listdir(data_path):
        path = os.path.join(data_path, f)
        if f.endswith(".pdf"):
            docs.extend(PyPDFLoader(path).load())
        elif f.endswith(".txt") or f.endswith(".md"):
            docs.extend(TextLoader(path).load())
    return docs

def build_vectorstore(docs):
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
    return vectorstore

def create_agent(vectorstore):
    retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.5)

    def agent(question: str) -> str:
        context_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
        context = "\n\n".join([d.page_content for d in context_docs])
        prompt = f"""You are Grant's personal Codex Agent. 
Answer questions in his voice, grounded in the following context:

{context}

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
        return llm.predict(prompt)

    return agent
```

```python
import streamlit as st
from rag_agent import load_documents, build_vectorstore, create_agent

st.set_page_config(page_title="Grant's Codex Agent", page_icon="📖")

@st.cache_resource
def init_agent():
    docs = load_documents("data")
    vs = build_vectorstore(docs)
    return create_agent(vs)

st.title("📖 Grant's Codex Agent")
st.write("Ask me anything about my experience, skills, and values!")

agent = init_agent()

query = st.text_input("Your question:")
if query:
    answer = agent(query)
    st.markdown("### Answer")
    st.write(answer)
```





## 2. How to add resources
**Prompt:**
I want to know how to do the following: Make radio buttons on the frontend to configure modes. Put in additional resources that can be fun facts about me like a link to my spotify playlist, chess.com username, and a newspaper article about me as a child. How do I integrate it into the app? Give me a clear step by step process on how to add features - explain it as simply as possible. Then provide me example code as to how to implement the features

---

**AI Response:**

Love this—let’s bolt on modes + “fun links” in a way that’s simple, free, and tidy. I’ll give you a clear checklist first, then drop copy-pasteable code.

---

# Step-by-step: add Modes (radio buttons) + Fun Resources

## A) Modes (Interview, Story, Fast Facts, Humble Brag, Reflect)

1. **Define your modes**
   Decide the set and what each should do (short + punchy vs narrative, etc.).

2. **Add radio buttons in the UI**
   In Streamlit, put a `st.radio` in the sidebar. The selected value becomes `mode`.

3. **Wire mode → prompt**
   Map each mode to a short instruction string and include it in your prompt to the LLM (or your heuristic fallback).

4. **(Optional) Mode-specific extras**
   For example, if `FastFacts`, also display bullet-point facts in the UI.

---

## B) Fun resources (Spotify, chess.com, childhood article)

You want them:

* **Visible in the UI** (clickable links)
* **Searchable by the agent** (so they can be referenced in answers)

We’ll do both:

1. **Add them to `config.yaml`**
   Put links + username in a structured `resources` block.

2. **Create a tiny `data/resources.md`**
   A simple markdown file listing those links and “fast facts”—so your RAG index ingests them like any other doc.

3. **Render them in the app**
   An expander called “Fun links about me”, with clickable links.

4. **(Optional) Use them in answers**
   If `FastFacts` mode is on, prepend some bullets from config to the answer.

---

# Example config + code

Below is *minimal* example code that you can drop into your existing Streamlit app (free stack; no paid APIs required). It assumes you already have a simple RAG setup and a `config.yaml`.

## 1) `config.yaml` — add resources + modes stay the same

```yaml
# ... your existing config ...
resources:
  spotify_playlist: "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/EXAMPLE"
  chess_username: "grant_booysen"
  chess_profile: "https://www.chess.com/member/grant_booysen"
  childhood_article: "https://news.example.com/article-about-grant"
  fast_facts:
    - "I’m happiest when shipping measurable things."
    - "Comfort stack: Python, SQL, PyTorch; sprinkle of GNNs."
    - "I debug with a thin end-to-end slice, then binary-search the stack."
    - "Former chess club troublemaker. Rapid ~1500."
```

## 2) `data/resources.md` — make it indexable by RAG

Create this file (ingestion will pick it up just like your CV/blogs):

```markdown
---
title: "Resources — Links & Fast Facts"
tags: ["links", "fun-facts"]
---

# Links
- Spotify playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/EXAMPLE
- Chess.com profile: https://www.chess.com/member/grant_booysen
- Childhood newspaper article: https://news.example.com/article-about-grant

# Fast Facts
- I’m happiest when shipping measurable things.
- Comfort stack: Python, SQL, PyTorch; sprinkle of GNNs.
- I debug with a thin end-to-end slice, then binary-search the stack.
- Former chess club troublemaker. Rapid ~1500.
```

## 3) Streamlit UI — radio buttons for modes + resources expander

Add this to your `app.py` (or integrate with your existing app):

```python
import streamlit as st
import yaml
from pathlib import Path

# --------- Load config ---------
cfg = yaml.safe_load(open("config.yaml", "r"))

def mode_instructions(mode: str) -> str:
    return {
        "Interview":  "Answer concisely and professionally. Prioritize skills, impact, clarity.",
        "Story":      "Answer with a short narrative and an example grounded in the docs.",
        "FastFacts":  "Answer in tight bullet points (max 5).",
        "HumbleBrag": "Be confident and specific about achievements; avoid exaggeration.",
        "Reflect":    "Self-assess energy, collaboration style, and growth areas with candor.",
    }.get(mode, "")

st.set_page_config(page_title="Personal Codex Agent", page_icon="🗂️")

# --------- Sidebar: Modes ---------
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Settings")
    mode = st.radio(
        "Mode",
        ["Interview", "Story", "FastFacts", "HumbleBrag", "Reflect"],
        index=0
    )
    st.caption("Mode tweaks tone & structure of answers.")

# --------- Main: Title + Resources ---------
st.title("🗂️ Personal Codex Agent")
st.caption("Ask about my work, skills, and values — grounded in my own docs.")

with st.expander("🔗 Fun links about me"):
    res = cfg.get("resources", {})
    if res:
        if res.get("spotify_playlist"):
            st.markdown(f"- **Spotify playlist:** [{res['spotify_playlist']}]({res['spotify_playlist']})")
        if res.get("chess_profile"):
            label = res.get("chess_username", res["chess_profile"])
            st.markdown(f"- **Chess.com:** [{label}]({res['chess_profile']})")
        if res.get("childhood_article"):
            st.markdown(f"- **Childhood article:** [{res['childhood_article']}]({res['childhood_article']})")
    else:
        st.info("Add links in `config.yaml → resources` to show them here.")

# --------- Query box ---------
st.write("Try questions like:")
st.code(
    "What kind of engineer are you?\n"
    "What are your strongest technical skills?\n"
    "What projects are you most proud of?\n"
    "What do you value in a team culture?\n"
    "How do you learn or debug something new?",
    language="text"
)

q = st.text_input("Your question")
go = st.button("Ask")

# --------- Replace these with your actual RAG calls ---------
def retrieve_context(question: str) -> str:
    # TODO: call your vector index and join top chunks here.
    # For now, return a placeholder.
    return "(context from your docs goes here)"

def answer_with_llm(system_prompt: str, user_prompt: str) -> str:
    # TODO: call your local LLM (e.g., Ollama) or your fallback.
    # For now, just echo how it would work.
    return f"🧠 (LLM would answer here)\n\n{user_prompt[:600]}..."

def build_system_prompt(mode: str) -> str:
    base = (
        "You are Grant Booysen's Personal Codex Agent.\n"
        "- Voice: concise, pragmatic, dry humor.\n"
        "- Speak in first person ('I', 'my').\n"
        "- Ground answers in the provided context from my documents.\n"
        "- If context is insufficient, say what you need.\n"
    )
    return base + f"\nCurrent Mode: {mode}\n"

# --------- Handle ask ---------
if go and q.strip():
    with st.spinner("Thinking..."):
        context = retrieve_context(q)
        instructions = mode_instructions(mode)
        user_prompt = (
            f"{instructions}\n\n"
            f"Question: {q}\n\n"
            f"Context:\n{context}\n\n"
            "If context is insufficient, say what you need."
        )
        system_prompt = build_system_prompt(mode)
        answer = answer_with_llm(system_prompt, user_prompt)

        # Mode-specific extras (e.g., FastFacts: prepend quick bullets)
        if mode == "FastFacts":
            facts = cfg.get("resources", {}).get("fast_facts", [])
            if facts:
                st.markdown("**Fast facts**")
                st.markdown("- " + "\n- ".join(facts))

        st.markdown(answer)
```

> Where to plug in RAG:
> Replace `retrieve_context()` with: search your FAISS/Chroma index for top-k chunks and join them.
> Replace `answer_with_llm()` with your **free** local model call (e.g., using **Ollama**).

---

## 4) (Optional) Free local LLM call with Ollama

If you’re on the free stack:

```python
from ollama import Client
ollama_client = Client()  # assumes `ollama` is running locally

def answer_with_llm(system_prompt: str, user_prompt: str) -> str:
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
    ]
    resp = ollama_client.chat(model="llama3", messages=messages)
    return resp["message"]["content"]
```

---

## 5) Make the links searchable by your agent (RAG)

You already created `data/resources.md`. Just **re-run your ingest step** so it’s in the index:

```bash
python scripts/ingest.py
```

Now if someone asks, “Do you have a playlist?” the retriever can surface those URLs.

---

# TL;DR (you asked for simple!)

1. Add a `resources` section into `config.yaml` with your links + facts.
2. Create `data/resources.md` (so the agent can “see” them).
3. Add a radio button for modes in Streamlit and pass the mode as instructions into the prompt.
4. Show the links in a Streamlit expander.
5. (Optional) In `FastFacts` mode, print bullet points from `config.yaml`.
6. Re-ingest docs so your resources are retrievable.

If you want the **ready-to-run starter zip** with these features already wired up (Streamlit app + RAG skeleton + resources block + FastFacts injection), say the word and I’ll hand you the download link.

## 3. How do I deploy this project?

**Prompt:**
I am trying to deploy my app to streamlit but I am having import issues. from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import faiss from ollama import Client import os  # Embeddings embedder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")  def build_vectorstore(docs):     texts = [d.page_content for d in docs]     embeddings = embedder.encode(texts)     dim = embeddings.shape[1]     index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)     index.add(embeddings)     return index, texts  # Local Ollama client ollama_client = Client()  def create_agent(index, texts):     def agent(question: str) -> str:         q_emb = embedder.encode([question])         D, I = index.search(q_emb, k=3)         context = "\n\n".join([texts[i] for i in I[0]])         prompt = f"""You are Grant's personal Codex Agent.  Answer based on the context below, in his own voice:  {context}  Question: {question} Answer:"""         response = ollama_client.chat(model="llama3", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])         return response['message']['content']     return agent and another file: import streamlit as st

**AI Response:**
Looking at your error logs, the main issue is that your `ui.py` file is trying to import `load_documents` from `rag_agent.py`, but that function doesn't exist in your `rag_agent.py` file.

Here are the issues I can see:

## Missing Function
Your `rag_agent.py` file is missing the `load_documents` function that `ui.py` is trying to import.

## HuggingFace Rate Limiting
The 429 errors from HuggingFace suggest you're hitting rate limits when trying to download the sentence transformer model.

Here's how to fix these issues:## Additional Steps to Fix Deployment

1. **Create a `data` directory** in your project root and add your documents (`.txt` or `.md` files)

2. **Update your `requirements.txt`** to handle the dependencies better:3. **Consider adding a fallback** for when Ollama isn't available in the cloud environment. Streamlit Cloud won't have Ollama running, so you might want to:## Key Changes Made:

1. **Added `load_documents` function** that was missing
2. **Added retry logic** for HuggingFace downloads to handle 429 errors
3. **Better error handling** throughout the code
4. **Added fallback options** for when services aren't available
5. **Made the code more robust** for cloud deployment

## Deployment Recommendations:

1. **For local development**: Use the first version with Ollama
2. **For Streamlit Cloud**: Use the OpenAI version and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your Streamlit secrets
3. **Create sample documents**: Add some `.txt` or `.md` files to a `data/` directory
4. **Test locally first** before deploying to make sure everything works

The main issue was the missing `load_documents` function and the HuggingFace rate limiting. These fixes should resolve your import errors and make your app more resilient to deployment issues.

4. How do I integrate a free tool like Groq into my service?





## 4. How to switch to free tools
**Prompt:**
can I not use llama for cloud deployment? Integrate my current setup with groq instead of Llama. Only change the necessary lines of code. 

---

**AI Response:**

You're right to ask about this - using Llama (via Ollama) for cloud deployment on Streamlit Cloud has some significant challenges:

## Why Ollama/Llama is problematic for Streamlit Cloud:

1. **No persistent compute**: Streamlit Cloud runs in containers that don't have Ollama installed and don't allow you to install system-level services
2. **Resource limitations**: Running local LLMs requires significant CPU/RAM that exceeds Streamlit Cloud's free tier limits
3. **Cold starts**: Even if you could run it, model loading would make your app extremely slow to start

## Better alternatives for cloud deployment:

### Option 1: Use Ollama via API (if you have a server)
If you have your own server running Ollama, you can connect to it remotely:### Option 2: Use Hugging Face Inference API (Free tier available)
This gives you access to Llama models without running them locally:### Option 3: Use Groq (Very fast Llama inference, free tier)
Groq offers incredibly fast Llama inference with a generous free tier:## My Recommendations:

1. **For development**: Keep using Ollama locally
2. **For cloud deployment**: Use **Groq** - it's free, fast, and gives you access to Llama 3 models
3. **Fallback option**: Hugging Face Inference API
4. **If you have your own server**: Remote Ollama

## Updated requirements.txt for Groq:
```
streamlit
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
faiss-cpu
groq
requests
urllib3
```

**Groq is probably your best bet** - they offer free access to Llama 3 models with very fast inference speeds, perfect for a Streamlit app. You just need to:

1. Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Get a free API key
3. Add it to your Streamlit secrets as `GROQ_API_KEY`

Would you like me to help you set up the Groq version?
---

**Final code snippet:**

from groq import Groq
import os

# Initialize Groq client
groq_client = Groq(api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

def create_agent(vectorstore_data):
    """Create agent using Groq's Llama"""
    if vectorstore_data is None:
        return lambda question: "Sorry, the knowledge base is not available."
    
    index, texts = vectorstore_data
    
    def agent(question: str) -> str:
        if not os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"):
            return "Please set GROQ_API_KEY environment variable"
        
        try:
            # Search for relevant documents
            q_emb = embedder.encode([question])
            D, I = index.search(q_emb.astype('float32'), k=3)
            context = "\n\n".join([texts[i] for i in I[0] if i < len(texts)])
            
            prompt = f"""You are Grant's personal Codex Agent. Answer based on the context below, in his own voice:

            response = groq_client.chat.completions.create(
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                model="llama3-8b-8192",  # or "llama3-70b-8192" for larger model
                max_tokens=500,
                temperature=0.7
            )
            
            return response.choices[0].message.content
            
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Sorry, I encountered an error: {str(e)}"
    
    return agent







5. Load data from different file types:
**Prompt**
How do I parse data from the following document types into the embedder: docx, pdf, md, txt. Write me the code to load these resources from ./data. and collectively add it to the context of the prompt. Give me just the code to do so.
