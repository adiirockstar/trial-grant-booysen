Good morning Adii,

I have just completed the project. It was a fun activity between my studies! If it is possible, would I be permitted to post the bot on my LinkedIn after the interview process is complete? I thoroughly enjoyed making it and want to expand it for my CV when I have the chance.

Here is all the information:

[Github](https://github.com/grantxxcoder/GrantCodex)

[App](https://grantcodex-6rj39zyuthekrcahs2lhjy.streamlit.app/)

Hope you enjoy what I have built!

The data that I used included the text from our correspondence so you will find a lot of responses tailored to Ubundi.

Kind regards,

Grant Booysen
