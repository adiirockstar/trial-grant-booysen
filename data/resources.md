I have loved the game of chess since a child! I have never really been any good but I am just in love with the strategy.

In my youth I trained for 12 years in Budo Karate at the legendary Malcolm Dorfman dojo in Parktown, Johannesburg. Under his tutelage I became a regional, national and unbelievably, a world champion. In my time training I was fortunate enough to grade to a black belt and most importantly, able to transfer my learnings to the younger karateka. Here are some articles that I recommend reading that point to my martial arts achievements.
